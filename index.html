        <h1>Hello, Young Witches & Wizards!</h1>
            <p class="lead">Welcome to your first year at Hogwarts.  We are glad to have you here and hope you have a magical experience over the next seven years with us.  One of the first things we do here at Hogwarts with first year students is sort them into their class houses.  The houses will become a sort of surrogate family during your eduction at Hogwarts.</p>
            <p class="lead">For many years we used a magical hat formerly belonging to Godric Gryffindor to complete the sorting, but this hat was destroyed during The Battle of Hogwarts of which no doubt you are familiar in which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was destroyed and his followers apprehended and locked away in Azkaban Prison by The Ministry of Magic.</p>
            <p class="lead">In order to modernize and prepare young Witches and Wizards with the modern Muggle World, in addition to adding Muggle Studies to all students curriculum in the 5th year, we are now sorting houses via the following web app.</p>
            <p class="lead">Students are also encouraged to download the Hogwarts Mobile App for their Android and iOS devices, where you can keep up-to-date on upcomming Quiddich Matches, House Points, areas of the Castle Ground to Avoid, a quick refence to rules, especially for first years (i.e. do not venture into the Forbbidden Forrest, do not wander into the East Wing of the Castle, and do not use the Room of Requirement to hide our during Potions Class).</p>
            <p class="lead">In addition, the mobile app allows you to call for Madam Poppy Pomfrey, the Castle Nurse, in the event of accidents, which frequently happen here.</p>
